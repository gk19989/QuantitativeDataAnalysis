    "1. __Develop the Reaserch Question__:\n",
    "> Before doing a Quantitative Research you should have a well-defined research question. This is done by literature review and looking into alternate theories.\n",
    "2. __Develop a Research Hypothesis__:\n",
    "> This is the step where Quantitative Research differs from Qualitative Research. Hypothesis is a primise or un-proven theory claimed by the researcher even before starting the data gathering.\n",
    "3. __Selection of Research Design__:\n",
    "> The selection of Research Design is not done by choice, but it depends on variables and the research question. There are four different research designs.\n",

    "4. __Selection of Population & Sample and Data Gathereing__:\n",
    "> Population is the entire group that you want to draw conclusions about, while sample is the smaller group of individuals you'll actually collect data from.\n",
    "5. __Data Analysis and Interpretation__:\n",
